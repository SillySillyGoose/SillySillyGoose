# HeyðŸ‘‹
I mainly work in svelte and html. (Including JS and CSS)

My newest project is a countdown that I made because someone asked me too.

# My Skill Level
Now, im not the best. But I still feel like I am still good enough to make a basic site.
<br>
I can also create some games in unity using c#!

# Github
Honestly. I love github. It's great allowing me to do what i need easily.
<br>
What I also like is how you can use HTML within the readme files and how they show up on the project!
<br>
Now, I dont know much about .md files so maybe thats not a github thing but yeah!


# If you want just have a look around!

# Bye! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹
