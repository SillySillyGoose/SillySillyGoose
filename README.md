# HeyğŸ‘‹
I mainly work in svelte and html. (Including JS and CSS)

My newest project is a countdown that I made because someone asked me too.

# My Skill Level
Now, im not the best. But I still feel like I am still good enough to make a basic site.
I can also create some games in unity using c#!

# If you want just have a look around!

# Bye! ğŸ‘‹ğŸ‘‹ğŸ‘‹
